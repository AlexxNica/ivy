  "body": "# ivy\r\n\r\nIVy is a research tool intended to allow interactive development of\r\nprotocols and their proofs of correctness and to provide a platform\r\nfor developing and experimenting with automated proof techniques. In\r\nparticular, IVy provides interactive visualization of automated\r\nproofs, and supports a use model in which the human protocol designer\r\nand the automated tool interact to expose errors and prove\r\ncorrectness.\r\n\r\n## prerequisites\r\n\r\n### python 2.7\r\n\r\nGet it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads) or as part of\r\nyour Linux distribution.\r\n\r\n### Z3\r\n\r\nFollowing the instructions [here](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) to\r\ninstall Z3. Set the environment variable Z3DIR to the prefix at which\r\nyou installed Z3. By defult this is /usr/local, in which case:\r\n\r\n    $ export Z3DIR = /usr/local\r\n\r\n### Python packages\r\n\r\nInstall the python packages ply and pygraphviz. On Ubuntu, install them\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install python-ply python-pygraphviz\r\n\r\n### tcl/tk/tcldot\r\n\r\nTo use the Tk-based user interface, you need to install the python\r\npackage tk, the tix widget set, and the tcldot package (part of\r\ngraphviz). On Ubuntu, install them all like this:\r\n\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install python-tk tix libgv-tcl\r\n\r\n## install\r\n\r\nGet the source like this:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/ivy.git\r\n\r\nSet the environment variable IVYDIR to point to the root of Ivy's\r\nsource tree, like this:\r\n\r\n    $ cd ivy\r\n    $ export IVYDIR=`pwd`\r\n\r\nAdd Ivy's bin directory to your path, like this:\r\n\r\n    $ export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH\r\n\r\n## run\r\n\r\nRun Ivy on an example, using the Tcl/Tk user interface:\r\n\r\n    $ cd examples/ivy\r\n    $ ivy client_server.ivy\r\n\r\n## emacs mode\r\n\r\nAn emacs major mode for Ivy is available in lib/emacs/ivy-mode.el. Put this file\r\nsomewhere in your emacs load path and add the following code to your\r\n.emacs:\r\n\r\n    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.ivy\\\\'\" . ivy-mode))\r\n    (autoload 'ivy-mode  \"ivy-mode.el\" \"Major mode for editing Ivy code\" t nil)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
