# This is a (more) concrete specification of the tilelink protocol. It specifies

# Oustanding issues:
#
#   Managers must include an up-to-date copy of the
#   data in Grants responding to Acquires upgrading permissions unless
#   they are certain that client has not been Probed since the Aquire
#   was issued.
#
# TODO: currently the spec requires all Grants to have data, even
# in the upgrade case.
#
#   The voluntary write’s data can be used to respond to the original
#   requestor with a Grant, but the transaction cannot complete until
#   the expected number of Releases have been collected by the manager.
#
# TODO: The spec may be too strict here, since it doesn't allow any grants
# to the acquiring client while there is an outstanding probe, even if a
# voluntary write has come in in the interim.
#
#
#   Managers are not obligated to accept both Acquires and merge the
#   transactions’ message flows, though they may choose to do so.
#
# TODO: In case of an upgrade, the spec requires the transactions to be merged.
