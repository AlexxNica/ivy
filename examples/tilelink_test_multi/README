This directory contains a tester for TileLink units with one manager
port and one client port.

The manager port may connect to multiple clients.

Bugs found by randomized testing
================================

L2BroadcastHub
--------------

Hub does not handle voluntary releases with the releaseInvalidatAck
type, which represent a release of a clean cache block. This was not
previously detected because the exiting L1 cache invalidates clean
blocks silently.

rocket-chip commit: 4fedd18

L2HellaCacheModule
------------------

1) Second and subsequent data beats of inner Grants had incorrect type in
case a shared Acquire was answered by an exclusive Grant. Possibly
this was not previously discovered because the L1 cached ignored these
fields.

Issues to be resolved
=====================

-- L2 cache requires that Acquires have allocation bit set. This is OK
if unset case is being reserved for future use. Perhaps there should
be an assertion?

-- Should L2 cache cached outer acquires be converted to getBlock?
